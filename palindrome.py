"""Pseudocode
a)Prompt user to choose the type of file
 i)Raw sequence
 ii)Fasta file format
 iiiï¼‰Genbank file format

b)Prompt user to enter sequence( Option1 ) or enter file name ( Option 2 and 3 ), else invalid input

c)Modify the sequneces
i)For input sequences, the sequence will be capitalise before checking for palindrome subsequences
ii)For Fasta file format, the system will read the content of file then extract out the sequence using re module and followed by capitalise the sequences
iii)For Genbank file format, the system will read the content of file then extract out the seuqence using re module and followed by capitalise the sequences

d)The sequences stored into variable 'seq' and print the input sequences

e)Function reversecomp called and print the reverse complementary of input sequences

f)Print the complementary of input sequences.


g)Function make_palin called to find the palindromic substrings inside the input seqeuences then store them into a table. In order to find the
palindromic subsequences, the function extract out the certain length of short sequence then reverse complement it. If the reverse
complement of the short sequence match with the original short sequences, then  check the original short sequence either contain space or not
with certain pattern. If yes, the short sequences will store into the table with type 'SPACER',else the short sequences will store into the
table with type 'NORMAL'. The function will repeat until the all the palindromic subsequences found and store into the table

h)Print the table

i) Prompt user to select Y for run the program again or N to quit the program.
